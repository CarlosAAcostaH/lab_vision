The images was processed with the tool GIMP&reg; to crop and fix the perspective. 

The images' color did not modificate.

The original images did not have the same perspective and therefor the size of windows, door, corners, stairs and others details were not similar. The perspective correction was used to relate the main facade of the chapel on the two images.

The perspective correction can be do with MATLAB&reg; with a 3x3 matrix to make a geometric transformation, but is easier in GIMP&reg; because the tool calculate the 3x3 matrix based on the move of points on the images.
