# Introduction to Images in Matlab

## Setup

1.  Start the virtual machine
2.  Clone the original lab vision repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/diego0020/lab_vision.git lab_vision_orig
    ```
3.  Clone your fork from the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<USER>/lab_vision.git lab_vision
    ```
4.  Copy the folder lab2_matlab to your repository

    ```bash
    cp -rf lab_vision_orig/lab2_matlab lab_vision
    ```
5.  Delete the original repository from your machine

    ```bash
    rm -rf lab_vision_orig
    ```
6.  Commit changes to your repository

    ```bash
    cd lab_vision
    git status
    git add *
    git commit -m "added matlab lab"
    ```
7.  Push changes

    ```bash
    git push
    ```    
8.  Download and uncompress the sipi_images misc folder in your home folder

    ```bash
    cd ~
    scp -r vision@guitaca.uniandes.edu.co:/home/vision/sipi_images/misc.tar.gz .
    # alternative
    # wget http://sipi.usc.edu/database/misc.tar.gz
    tar -xzf misc.tar.gz
    ```    
9.  Open matlab

## Working directory

The following commands can be used inside matlab, just like in bash

    -   pwd
    -   ls
    -   cd

For more file system see http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/file-operations.html

Note the current directory is also shown at the top of the graphical interface

1.  Change to the *misc* directory, which contains the uncompressed sipi_images
2.  List the contents of the directory

## Reading Images

The [imread](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imread.html) command is used in matlab to read images. 

1.  Look at the manual page for the command
2.  Read the ``5.1.12`` image
    
    What is the dimension of the output?
    >   answer

3.  Read the ``4.2.03`` image
    What is the dimension of the output?
    >   answer

## Displaying Images

The following commands can be used for displaying images

-   [image](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/image.html)
-   [imshow](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imshow.html)

1.  Look at their manual pages
2.  Try displaying the images read in the previous point using both commands
3.  What are the differences?
    > answer

## Writing Images

The [imwrite](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imwrite.html) image is used for writing images to disk

1.  Look at the manual page
2.  Write one of the images from before as png and as jpg
3.  Write a matlab function that takes the path of an image and converts it to jpg

## Matlab and the shell

### Shell from Matlab

It is possible to excecute bash commands from matlab by using the [system](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/system.html) command
or by using a [bang](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/run-external-commands-scripts-and-programs.html)

1.  Look at the manual pages
2.  Try it (for example ``!ps``)

### Matlab from the shell

It is also possible to invoke matlab in a non interactive mode to run a script from the terminal. If the matlab
binary is on the system PATH you can do something like this

```bash
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r "write_jpg('boat.512.tiff'); exit"
# or
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash script.m"
```
If the command or script doesn't end in ``exit`` the matlab shell will stay open, and will block the bash script.


1.  Create a script for converting all tiff images to jpeg
    -   You may create a bash script that calls matlab
    -   Or a matlab script that calls bash 
    -   Or both
