# Introduction to Images in Matlab

## Setup

1.  Start the virtual machine
2.  Clone the original lab vision repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/diego0020/lab_vision.git lab_vision_orig
    ```
3.  Clone your fork from the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<USER>/lab_vision.git lab_vision
    ```
4.  Copy the folder lab2_matlab to your repository

    ```bash
    cp -rf lab_vision_orig/lab2_matlab lab_vision
    ```
5.  Delete the original repository from your machine

    ```bash
    rm -rf lab_vision_orig
    ```
6.  Commit changes to your repository

    ```bash
    cd lab_vision
    git status
    git add *
    git commit -m "added matlab lab"
    ```
7.  Push changes

    ```bash
    git push
    ```    
8.  Download and uncompress the sipi_images misc folder in your home folder

    ```bash
    cd ~
    scp -r vision@guitaca.uniandes.edu.co:/home/vision/sipi_images/misc.tar.gz .
    # alternative
    # wget http://sipi.usc.edu/database/misc.tar.gz
    tar -xzf misc.tar.gz
    ```    
9.  Open matlab

**IMPORTANT**
This file contains questions, you should write your answers here and don't forget to **commit** and **push** to
your github account.

## Working directory

The following commands can be used inside matlab, just like in bash

    -   pwd
    -   ls
    -   cd

For more file system see http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/file-operations.html

Note the current directory is also shown at the top of the graphical interface

1.  Change to the *misc* directory, which contains the uncompressed sipi_images
2.  List the contents of the directory

## Reading Images

The [imread](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imread.html) command is used in matlab to read images. 

1.  Look at the manual page for the command
2.  Read the ``5.1.12`` image
    
    What is the dimension of the output?
    >   answer

3.  Read the ``4.2.03`` image
    What is the dimension of the output?
    >   answer

## Displaying Images

The following commands can be used for displaying images

-   [image](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/image.html)
-   [imshow](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imshow.html)

1.  Look at their manual pages
2.  Try displaying the images read in the previous point using both commands
3.  What are the differences?
    > answer

## Writing Images

The [imwrite](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imwrite.html) image is used for writing images to disk

1.  Look at the manual page
2.  Write one of the images from before as png and as jpg
3.  Write a matlab function that takes the path of an image and converts it to jpg

## Matlab and the shell

### Shell from Matlab

It is possible to excecute bash commands from matlab by using the [system](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/system.html) command
or by using a [bang](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/run-external-commands-scripts-and-programs.html)

1.  Look at the manual pages
2.  Try it (for example ``!ps``)

### Matlab from the shell

It is also possible to invoke matlab in a non interactive mode to run a script from the terminal. If the matlab
binary is on the system PATH you can do something like this

```bash
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r "write_jpg('boat.512.tiff'); exit"
# or
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash script.m"
```
If the command or script doesn't end in ``exit`` the matlab shell will stay open, and will block the bash script.

### Exercise

1.  Create a script for converting all tiff images to jpeg
    -   You may create a bash script that calls matlab
    -   Or a matlab script that calls bash 
    -   Or both
2.  Save this script in the matlab lab folder of your git repository

## Filters

### adding noise

The [imnoise](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imnoise.html) command can be used to add noise to images.
We can do this to simulate difficult capture conditions, and evaluate the algorithms over difficult situations.

1.  Read the manual page
2.  Try the diffente noise types, and save the noisy images to the repository (5 images)
3.  Try saving noisy images as jpg, what happens?
    > answer

### Median filter

These filters can be applied to a an image in order to remove noise. 
-   To apply a mean filter create it with the function [fspecial](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/fspecial.html)
    and apply it with [imfilter](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imfilter.html) 
-   To apply a median filter use the function [medfilt2](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/medfilt2.html)

1.  Read the manuals for the functions described above
2.  Try applying both kinds of filters to noisy images. Be sure to zoom in to see the effects
3.  Try different sizes for the filters
4.  Which filter works best for salt & pepper noise?
    > Answer

### Blur

To blur or smooth an image we can use the mean filter described above. We can also use the gaussian filter
which can be otained from [fspecial](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/fspecial.html).

1.  Smooth an image using average and gaussian filters
2.  Try different sizes for the filters
3.  What are the differences?
    > Answer

### Sharpen

The [imsharpen](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imsharpen.html) function lets us sharpen an image. 

1.  Sharp the ``5.1.12`` image. What do you notice?
    > Answer
2.  Sharp a blurred image. What do you notice?
    > Answer

### Edge detection

The following filters from fspecil can be used to enhance edges in an image
-   laplacian
-   log
-   prewitt
-   sobel

Notice that the last two filters detect horizontal edges, in order to detect vertical edges you have to transpose them.

1.  Try applying this filters
2.  What is the difference between prewitt and sobel?
    > Answer

More sophisticated methods for finding edges can be found in the following pages
